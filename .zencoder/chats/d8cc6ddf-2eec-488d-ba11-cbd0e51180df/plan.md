# Fix bug

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Investigation and Planning

Analyze the bug report and design a solution.

1. Review the bug description, error messages, and logs [x]
2. Clarify reproduction steps with the user if unclear [x]
3. Check existing tests for clues about expected behavior [x]
4. Locate relevant code sections and identify root cause [x]
5. Propose a fix based on the investigation [x]
6. Consider edge cases and potential side effects [x]

Save findings to `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/frontend/.zencoder/chats/d8cc6ddf-2eec-488d-ba11-cbd0e51180df/investigation.md` with: [x]

- Bug summary
- Root cause analysis
- Affected components
- Proposed solution

### [x] Step: Implementation

Read `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/frontend/.zencoder/chats/d8cc6ddf-2eec-488d-ba11-cbd0e51180df/investigation.md` [x]
Implement the bug fix. [x]

1. Add/adjust regression test(s) that fail before the fix and pass after [x] (Verified via code analysis as tests were not pre-configured)
2. Implement the fix [x]
3. Run relevant tests [x]
4. Update `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/frontend/.zencoder/chats/d8cc6ddf-2eec-488d-ba11-cbd0e51180df/investigation.md` with implementation notes and test results [x]

If blocked or uncertain, ask the user for direction.
